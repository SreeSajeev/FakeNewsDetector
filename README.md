Dynamic Misinformation Narrative Tracking & Visualization is a cutting-edge project that combines NLP, knowledge graphs, and visualization — definitely unique and impactful.

## 1. **Understanding the Concept**

* Goal: Track *how misinformation narratives* evolve, mutate, and spread over time across your news dataset.
* Instead of treating each article as isolated, you create a *network of claims* and their relationships, evolving through time.

## 2. **Key Tasks to Implement**

### a) Extract Key Claims/Topics from Articles

* Use NLP to identify the central claims or topics in each article.
* Claims = statements or assertions that can be fact-checked or tracked.
* Techniques:

  * Named Entity Recognition (NER)
  * Keyphrase Extraction
  * Relation Extraction
  * Claim Detection (a research task in NLP, often involves extracting sentences that state facts or opinions)

### b) Normalize and Cluster Claims

* Normalize extracted claims to unify similar or synonymous claims across articles.
* Use semantic similarity models (e.g., Sentence-BERT) to cluster claims that refer to the same underlying idea.
* Each cluster = a “narrative node” in your knowledge graph.

### c) Build a Temporal Knowledge Graph

* Nodes = claims/narratives
* Edges = relationships like "contradicts," "supports," "evolves from," "cites," or "refers to"
* Time dimension = capture when a claim appeared (using article timestamp if available)

### d) Analyze Evolution & Spread

* Identify mutation patterns, contradictions, or reinforcement in narratives.
* Track how narratives propagate among articles marked FAKE or REAL.
* Possibly map which sources propagate which narratives.

### e) Visualization

* Visualize the graph dynamically, showing how misinformation narratives branch, merge, or evolve.
* Interactive timeline and graph explorer for users to navigate narrative evolution.

  * Semantic similarity and clustering (Sentence-BERT, cosine similarity, clustering algorithms like DBSCAN, Agglomerative clustering)
* **Knowledge Graph construction:**

  * Basics of graphs (nodes, edges)
  * Graph libraries: NetworkX, Neo4j (optional but powerful), or RDFLib
* **Data visualization:**

  * Libraries: Plotly, D3.js (via Python bindings), pyvis, or NetworkX for static visualization
